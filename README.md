Getting Started
-----------------
The book usually covers MEL, However, for my own convenience, I have used maya python instead.<br>
Hence, I won't cover up the whole basic python and also, some knoweldge is required beforehand judging by the content of the book.<br>
~~I may upload additional Maya python sample codes if needed in future.~~ <br>
~~So make sure you fork this repos or subscribe~~<br>

* **Basic Python knowledge**
* Basic Maya knowledge on 3D Modeling
* Basic Computer Graphics

> Software
* Autodesk MAYA 2014 and up
* After Effect CS6 and up(if necessary)
