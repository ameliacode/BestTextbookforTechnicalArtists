Getting Started
-----------------
The book usually covers MEL, However, for my own convenience, I use maya python instead.<br>
Hence, I won't cover up the whole basic python and also, some requirements are required beforehand judged by the content of the book.<br>

> Requirements
* **Basic Python knowledge**
* Basic Maya knowledege on 3D Modeling
* Basic Computer Graphics

> Software
* Autodesk MAYA 2014 and up
* After Effect CS6 and up(if necessary)
